# RunelitePlugins

Automation plugins for Runelite. Fork of [PiggyPlugins](https://github.com/0Hutch/PiggyPlugins) which itself is a fork of EthanVann's EthanApiPlugins. üòÅ

Without their hard work this wouldn't be possible. Be sure to check out these projects as well.

## Plugins*:

### ChinBreakHandler
```
Made by Owain and taken from the PiggyPlugins repo to work with runelite.

Automatic break handling - easy to integrate and works really well.
```

### IronBuddy
```
Supports several low-level activities if you're looking to knock out some construction and/or crafting XP.

- building oak larders and unnoting logs at phials
- making molten glass at a furnace from soda ash and buckets of sand
- bankstand activities: glassblowing
```
### RuneUtils
```
Very rudimentary pathing system - can be used to walk almost anywhere on the OSRS map
without the need of a predetermined path or starting point.

Will grow to ecompass many utilities that open source bot developers can take advantage of.
```

# Instructions
Simply drag and drop `plugin-loader` into your `sideloaded-plugins` folder.

If you already have EthanApiPlugin on your runelite already, open loader config & disable the option to download EthanApi.

If you don't have a `sideloaded-plugins` folder, you'll want to grab `ethan-api-standalone` from EthanVann's repo and install the Runelite hijacker. You can reach out to me if you have any questions about this.
